# Second Year PhD Poster
This is the poster I presented at the [Graduate School Poster Day 2016](http://www.iad.ed.ac.uk/bio/pgconference.htm) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, UK.

Here I present the work I have done on Ebola phylodynamics, which has been partially published in  [Dudas et al. (2016)](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/02/071779.1) and [Diehl et al. (2016)](). 

## Association between the GP-A82V mutation and disease severity
[Diehl et al. (2016)]() presented experimental evidence that a mutation from Alanine to Valine in the Glycoprotein (82nd position) conferred increased infectivity specific to human cells.
The question was then if the mutation also had an impact on disease severity.

More details and a cool animation showing the spread of A82V in West Africa can be found in the [public repository](https://github.com/maxbiostat/diehl_ebola_cell_2016) for the paper.
