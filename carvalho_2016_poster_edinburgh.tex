 \item The 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic was the largest in history;
 \item A massive international collaboration produced the most comprehensive data set for an acute virus to date (over 5\% sampling);
 \item Our challenge is to combine different sources of information (epidemiological, genetic, climatic, etc) to trace the epidemic and explain its mode and \texit{tempo}.
 \item Investigate the role of particular mutations in disease severity;

In total $1610$ genomes were sequenced so far.
We take a Bayesian approach and estimate time-calibrated phylogenies with \textbf{BEAST}.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
 \item[$\oint$] We had viral load ($C(t)$ values) and outcome (death/survival) information for $236$ patients $\rightarrow$ binomial GLM;
 \item[$\oint$] Case counts ($\mathbf{Y}$) along climatic and socio-economic covariates ($\mathbf{X}$) for $56$ locations $\rightarrow$ negative binomial GLM + SSVS:
\begin{align*}
 Y_i & \sim \text{NegBin}(p_i, r) \\
 p_i & = \frac{r}{(r + \lambda_i)}  \\ 
\log(\lambda_i) &= \alpha + \beta_{1}\delta_{1} x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_{P}\delta_{P} x_{iP} 
\end{align*}

 \item[$\oint$] Constructing outbreak clusters: every time a location receives a viral introduction that leads to $>$20 sampled cases, split the series before and after the introduction.
